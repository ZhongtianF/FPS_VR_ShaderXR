# 🚁 TP5 – Drone Control System (Unity)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a **physically-based drone control system** in Unity, integrating movement, camera tracking, audio feedback and visual effects into a coherent and modular architecture.

The objective of TP5 is to demonstrate the **integration of concepts learned during TP3 and TP4** into a complete, stable and maintainable interactive system.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement realistic drone movement using Unity physics  
- Ensure smooth camera follow for user comfort  
- Provide coherent visual and audio feedback linked to the drone state  
- Maintain a clean, modular and maintainable code architecture

Each script has a **single responsibility** and is decoupled from the others.

## ⚙️ Core Components

### 🛩️ Drone Movement
**File:** `DroneMovement.cs`

- Uses `Rigidbody` for physically-based movement
- Controls thrust, pitch, roll and yaw
- Applies smooth forces and rotation limits
- Ensures stable and realistic drone behavior

This script represents the **core logic of the drone system**.

---

### 🎥 Camera Follow
**File:** `CameraMovement.cs`

- Smooth camera tracking using interpolation
- Vertical offset linked to drone orientation
- Improves readability and user comfort

Designed to avoid abrupt camera motion.

---

### 🔊 Audio Feedback
**File:** `AudioController.cs`

- Audio pitch and volume dynamically adjusted based on drone speed
- Audio logic fully decoupled from movement logic

Enhances immersion through speed-based sound feedback.

---

### 🌪️ Visual Feedback – Propellers
**File:** `PropellerMovement.cs`

- Propeller rotation speed linked to drone velocity
- Ensures visual coherence with physical behavior

Demonstrates animation control driven by gameplay parameters.

---

### 💥 Collision Detection
**File:** `SparkCollisionDetection.cs`

- Detects collisions using Unity physics
- Triggers visual effects through event-based logic
- No direct dependency on rendering components

Ensures a clean separation between **game logic** and **visual effects**.

---

## 🎨 Shaders & Animations (TP3 / TP4 Reuse)

Shaders and animations developed during TP3 and TP4 are reused in this project.

- Animations are driven by gameplay parameters (speed, collision)
- Visual effects are triggered by events
- Rendering logic remains independent from control logic

This demonstrates a correct **reuse and integration of previous work**, without mixing responsibilities.

---

## ✅ Technical Choices & Best Practices
- Modular architecture (single responsibility per script)
- Event-driven interactions
- Clear separation between logic, visuals and audio
- Physically-based movement using Unity `Rigidbody`
- Maintainable and scalable code structure

---

## 🧪 Tested Features
- Stable drone movement
- Smooth camera tracking
- Dynamic audio and animation feedback
- Collision-triggered visual effects

---

## 🛠️ Unity Version
- Unity 6000.0.62f1

---

## 📎 Notes
This project focuses on **system integration and code quality**, rather than graphical complexity, in accordance with the objectives of TP5.
